# Web Scraping, Analysis, and Prediction Project

## 📖 Description

This project was created for learning purposes. It features a web scraper designed to retrieve data from a specified URL. The collected data is then used for analysis and to build a predictive model.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

-   **Web Scraping:** Develop a robust scraper to automatically collect data from ... .
-   **Data Analysis:** Clean, process, and analyze the scraped data to uncover insights and patterns.
-   **Predictive Modeling:** Implement a machine learning model to make predictions based on the dataset.
